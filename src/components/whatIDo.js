        <h1>What I do</h1>
        <h4>
          <strong>I'm a full-stack developer</strong>
        </h4>
        <p>
          I develop websites and web applications. I currently work mainly on
          the front-end but am evolving my back-end skills.
        </p>
        <h4>
          <strong>I'm a blog writerr</strong>
        </h4>
        <p>
          I write on Medium about holistic personal evolution. I focus on
          methods of growing mind, body and brain for learning, performance and
          happiness.
        </p>
        <h4>I'm a biohacker</h4>
        <p>
          I optimize my sleep, supplementation, nootropic intake, nutrition,
          exercise & mindfulness for learning, performance and happiness.{" "}
        </p>
        <h4>I'm an entrepreneur</h4>
        <p>
          I look to various fields of arts and science to cross-pollinate
          start-ups with ideas & methods for solutions to problems. I believe
          there are more opportunities now than ever before.
        </p>

        <h1>Why I do it</h1>

        <h3>
          Long-term vision: <br />
          <span className="vision--statement">
            Boost love & reduce suffering as much as possible.
          </span>
        </h3>
        <p className="margin--zero">
          Another definition of my mission could be to increase the well-being
          of conscious beings in the world. I believe that the most efficient
          way to pursue this goal is by upgrading myself (biohacking) and my
          abilities so that I in the future have greater abilities to influence
          the well-being of other people. I suspect that technology will only
          grow more important in the world we live in, hence I'm a full-stack
          developer. I believe that writing is an important skill to have & that
          the money and following I can build on Medium can be useful for my
          goal of effective altruism. Looking to seize opportunities & creating
          value by starting businesses is another method of increasing the
          well-being in the world as much as possible in the long-term. This is
          a result of the solving of problems people have and the power to
          influence (money, relationships) a successful venture can yield.
